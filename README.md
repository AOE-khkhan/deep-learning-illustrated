# Deep Learning Illustrated (2019)

This repository is home to the code that accompanies [Jon Krohn](https://www.jonkrohn.com/), [Grant Beyleveld](http://grantbeyleveld.com/about/) and [Agla√© Bassens](https://www.aglaebassens.com/)' book [Deep Learning Illustrated](https://www.deeplearningillustrated.com/). This visual, interactive guide will be published by Addison-Wesley in 2019. 

## Installation

Step-by-step guides for running the code in this repository can be found in the [installation directory](https://github.com/the-deep-learners/deep-learning-illustrated/tree/master/installation). For installation difficulties, please consider visiting our book's [Q&A forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/deep-learning-illustrated) instead of creating an _Issue_.

## Notebooks

All of the code covered in the book can be found in [the notebooks directory](https://github.com/the-deep-learners/deep-learning-illustrated/tree/master/notebooks) as [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).
